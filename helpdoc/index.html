<h1 align="center">InfoPad alpha-4</h1>
<h2 align="center">Christopher De Vries</h2>
<p>It seems like only yesterday I thought to myself, "If only I had a
searchable notepad to hold small random stuff on my computer I would be
completely content in life." This is that thought's story.</p>
<p>This should be fairly simple to use. InfoPad is modeled on a spirally bound
note pad, though unlike a spiral note pad it can grow, shrink, and contains a
search function. Basically just type in anything you
want into a blank note. You can navigate backward and forwards in your InfoPad
using the "<code>Previous</code>" and "<code>Next</code>" buttons. You can
create new blank notes by using the
"<code>File&gt;New Note</code>" menu option. You can delete notes by using the
"<code>File&gt;Delete Note</code>" menu option, and of course save notes using
the "<code>File&gt;Save Notes</code>" menu option. The InfoPad checks every
minute to see if you have made any changes and automatically saves your notes
if that is the case.</p>
<p>Organization of your random notes is achieved through the search bar. As you
type in the elements of a search matching elements will be highlighted in
yellow in the
next note which contains a match. To flip through multiple matching notes click
the "<code>Find Next</code>" button. If unable to find a match, nothing will be
highlighted. The search bar can perform regular expression searches making it
quite powerful.</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>This is alpha quality software. It seems to work pretty well for me, but
there are probably problems I have not found yet. Please email me at
<code>nissyen@users.sourceforge.net</code> if you have any problems or want to
offer some suggestions. Future versions may be incompatible with the current
note format, so keep in mind that all your notes may be lost if you upgrade to
the beta and release versions. After beta versions I will maintain backward
compatibility in the note files, but I make no guarantees about this
version. If you need your notes you can always copy them to a text file and
then copy them back after upgrading.</p>

<h2>Features Planned for Version 1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some sort of warning if it's not automatically saving
<li>The ability to sync up to a note server over the internet.
<li>Implementing good suggestions from users.
</ul>
