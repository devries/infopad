<h1 align="center">InfoPad alpha-5</h1>
<h2 align="center">Christopher De Vries</h2>
<p>It seems like only yesterday I thought to myself, "If only I had a
searchable notepad to hold small random stuff on my computer I would be
completely content in life." This is that thought's story.</p>
<p>This should be fairly simple to use. InfoPad is modeled on a spirally bound
note pad, though unlike a spiral note pad it can grow, shrink, and contains a
search function. Basically just type in anything you
want into a blank note. You can navigate backward and forwards in your InfoPad
using the "<code>Previous</code>" and "<code>Next</code>" buttons. You can
create new blank notes by using the
"<code>File&gt;New Note</code>" menu option. You can delete notes by using the
"<code>File&gt;Delete Note</code>" menu option, and of course save notes using
the "<code>File&gt;Save Notes</code>" menu option. The InfoPad checks every
minute to see if you have made any changes and automatically saves your notes
if that is the case.</p>
<p>Organization of your random notes is achieved through the search bar. As you
type in the elements of a search matching elements will be highlighted in
yellow in the
next note which contains a match. To flip through multiple matching notes click
the "<code>Find Next</code>" button. If unable to find a match, nothing will be
highlighted. The search bar can perform regular expression searches making it
quite powerful.</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>This is alpha quality software. It seems to work pretty well for me, but
there are probably problems I have not found yet. Please email me at
<code>nissyen@users.sourceforge.net</code> if you have any problems or want to
offer some suggestions. Future versions may be incompatible with the current
note format, so keep in mind that all your notes may be lost if you upgrade to
the beta and release versions. After beta versions I will maintain backward
compatibility in the note files, but I make no guarantees about this
version. If you need your notes you can always copy them to a text file and
then copy them back after upgrading.</p>

<h2>Features Planned for Version 1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some sort of warning if it's not automatically saving
<li>The ability to sync up to a note server over the internet.
<li>Implementing good suggestions from users.
</ul>

<h2>License</h2>
<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package
may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of
the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. </p>

<p>Definitions:
<ul>
    <li> "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
      Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
      textual modification. 
    <li> "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
      or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
      Holder. 
    <li> "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
      the package. 
    <li> "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
      Package. 
    <li> "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
      media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You
      will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to
      the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 
    <li> "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
      though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
      that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions
      they received it. 
</ul></p>
<ol>
<li> You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
   Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
   duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 

<li> You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in
   such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 

<li> You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 
<ol type="a">
    <li> place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
    equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
    such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
    modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. 

    <li> use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    <li> rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
    standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
    manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
    differs from the Standard Version. 

    <li> make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
</ol>
<li> You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 
<ol type="a">
    <li> distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
    get the Standard Version. 

    <li> accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
    Package with your modifications. 

    <li> accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
    Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard
    names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or
    equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
    Version. 

    <li> make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
</ol>
<li> You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
   Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You
   may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute
   this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part
   of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do
   not advertise this Package as a product of your own. 

<li> The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
   from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
   copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be
   sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. 

<li> C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
   be considered part of this Package. 

<li> The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
   products derived from this software without specific prior written
   permission. 

<li> THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
